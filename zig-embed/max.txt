"What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I
have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response
were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational
thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to
it."

â€” Josh Mostel as Principal Max Anderson in Billy Madison (1995)
