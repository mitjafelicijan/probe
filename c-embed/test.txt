The first rule is typical of quantum physics. It results from the postulate of
unitary evolution. The second rule is a classical rule of the addition of
probabilities. It results from decoherence through observation. When
intermediate states are observed, the observed system is represented by a
mixture of states. The classical rule of addition of probabilities must then be
applied. Entanglement by observation thus explains Feynman's second rule. This
explains the Feynman Rules for calculating probabilities in quantum physics
(Feynman 1966).
